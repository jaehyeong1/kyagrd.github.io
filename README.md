My thesis research is about theories and language design for
a logically consistent system that is convenient for both
functional programming and logical reasoning, based on the Curry--Howard correspondence.

My research interests, other than my thesis, are on programming languages:
type systems, automated testing (using solvers), formal verification, subtyping for algebraic datatypes,
and other aspects of functional languages.
Further details are summarized in
my [CV (or, resume)](https://github.com/kyagrd/cv/blob/master/kyagrd_tumblr_cv.pdf?raw=true).
List of my publications are also available on
my [Google Scholar profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n-GwE98AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

One of my favorate programming language is [Haskell](http://haskell.org/).
So, I've translated Graham Hutton's "Programming in Haskell" into Korean,
first Korean print published in 2009.
