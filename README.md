Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://cs.pdx.edu/)

My thesis research is about theories and language design for
a logically consistent system that is convenient for both
functional programming and logical reasoning, based on the Curry--Howard correspondence.
My research interests, other than my thesis, are on programming languages:
type systems, automated testing (using solvers), formal verification, subtyping for algebraic datatypes,
and other aspects of functional languages.

See my [CV](https://github.com/kyagrd/cv/blob/master/kyagrd_tumblr_cv.pdf?raw=true) for details.
