My primary reserach focus is currently on [the TIPER proejct](http://kyagrd.github.io/tiper/),
which aims to designe and develope tool that automatically generates
Type Inference Prototyping Engines from Executable Relational specifcations
of polymorphic type systems. This project will be combining theriteical
and techincal advances in the Functional Programming
and the Logic Programming communities, in order to
realize a missing peice of language frontend construction toolset:
we already have lexer/parser geneartors (e.g. Yacc) but missing
static type system generators.
See [the TIPER project hompage](http://kyagrd.github.io/tiper/) for further details.

My thesis research was about theories and language design for
a logically consistent system that is convenient for both
functional programming and logical reasoning, based on the Curry--Howard correspondence.
In my thesis I designed a language called Nax, proved theoretic properteis about
the language by studing its underlying calclulus (which is also my conribution).
I've also implemted [a subset of Nax](https://github.com/kyagrd/mininax),
which motivated the TIPER proejct mentioned previously because
the added complexity makes it difficult to keep track of
whether the implementation is faithful to the design written on paper.

In addtion I am generally intereseted on programming languages related subjects:
type systems, automated testing (using solvers), formal verification,
subtyping for algebraic datatypes, and other aspects of functional languages.

Further details about me are summarized in
my [CV (or, resume)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t5l62rtlmsac6q1/kyagrd_tumblr_cv.pdf)
and
the list of my publications are also available on
my [Google Scholar profile](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n-GwE98AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

One of my favorate programming language is [Haskell](http://haskell.org/).
So, I've translated Graham Hutton's "Programming in Haskell" into Korean,
first Korean print published in 2009.
