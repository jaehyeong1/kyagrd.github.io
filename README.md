Ph.D. in [Computer Science](http://cs.pdx.edu/)
at [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/)
(advised by [Tim Sheard](http://cs.pdx.edu/~sheard/))

B.S. in [Computer Science](http://cs.kaist.ac.kr/)
at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/).

My thesis research is about theories and language design for
a logically consistent system that is convenient for both
functional programming and logical reasoning, based on the Curry--Howard correspondence.
My research interests, other than my thesis, are on programming languages:
type systems, automated testing (using solvers), formal verification, subtyping for algebraic datatypes,
and other aspects of functional languages.
